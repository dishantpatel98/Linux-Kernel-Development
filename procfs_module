Procfs is a internal   kernel static module,there is no  support, for dynamic kernel module, for this component. 

 --->since it is one of the most essential 
         kernel component, disabling is 
         unacceptable  
-->this document describes the architecture and 
  design of procfs component/subsystem/module
  
       this frame-work /sub-system
       --->exports system APIs and their rules
       --->provides system objects and their 
           rules 
       --->maintains system lists and meta-data
       --->supports managing call backs  

- procfs is a "special file system resident" 
  , in main memory/system-space - does not store data/
  user-data/application-data  - 
  does manage special files, known as "procfs 
  files and directories" - 
  in Unix/Linux language, it is known 
  as "a pseudo file system/synthetic file system" - 
  "it does support 
  meta-data(data used to manage)" , 
  "not stored file data" - only meta-data
  is stored, in these file systems, "not actual data" - 
    - it is a "static kernel module" that is 
      "registered" with 
      "VFS layer" - "VFS layer" is connected to 
      "system call interface layer"

          there is 
          a virtual file switch(VFS) and 
          this is linked/registered to
          system call interface layer
          
          procfs component 
          is registered with VFS layer
      --->similarly, other system components/ 
          modules are registered, with procfs
          layer          
-->Linux manages to support multiple filesystem types.

The idea behind the Virtual Filesystem is to put a wide range of information in the
kernel to represent many different types of filesystems;
